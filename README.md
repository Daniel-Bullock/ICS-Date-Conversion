# ISC-Date-Conversion
Takes as arbitrary input of an ICS file and start date and generates output: ICS file that is shifted such that the first calendar event is on the new input date and the rest of the events follow accordingly to the shift amount.

(note: unfortunately currently the only way to run the program is to download the program, working on a fix)

Directions for running:


1. Download files to computer and unzip
2. Run iscShifter.py
3. Input the input calendar in format 'input_calendar.ics'
4. Input year, month, and date
5. Output will be in unzipped folder.
